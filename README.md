# MERN Stack E-Commerce Mobile Application

## Overview
I developed this codebase while following the content of the Udemy course available at the following link: https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-e-commerce-mobile-app-react-native-redux-expo/. It covers the development of a MERN stack e-commerce mobile application using React Native, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

This Udemy course covers the development of a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack e-commerce mobile application using. Here's what you can expect from the course:
- Building a great eCommerce mobile application with React Native, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Developing cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile apps without requiring knowledge of Swift, ObjectiveC, or Java/Android.
- Creating an actual real-world project built in a linear and progressive manner.
- Dividing the course content so you can focus on FullStack, Frontend, or Backend development.
- Implementing an admin area to manage customers, products, and orders from a mobile phone.
- Incorporating features like product search, carousel, and more.
- Learning Node.js API (Backend) Development.
- Implementing authentication based on JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Understanding the terminology and concepts of Redux for state management.
- Getting up to speed with React design principles and methodologies.
- Making truly reusable components that look great.
- Discovering mobile design patterns used by experienced engineers.
